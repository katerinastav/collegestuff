# Supervised Learning
> the target is known (which class an instance belongs to) and a model is trained to
predict that target.

> Input data is called training data and has a known label or result such as spam/not-spam or a stock price at a time.
A model is prepared through a training process in which it is required to make predictions and is corrected when those predictions are wrong. The training process continues until the model achieves a desired level of accuracy on the training data. Example problems are classification and regression.

## Classification: classify data set in one or more predefined classes
>To predict the outcome of a given sample where the output variable is in the form of categories. Examples include labels such as male and female, sick and healthy.

## Regression: predictive technique (associate data set to a quantitative variable and predict the value of that variable)
>To predict the outcome of a given sample where the output variable is in the form of real values. Examples include real-valued labels denoting the amount of rainfall, the height of a person.

#### Simple Linear Regression

#### Multiple Linear Regression

#### Logistic Regression

#### NaÃ¯ve Bayes

#### KNN

#### Desicion Tree (Classification)

# Unsupervised Learning
> the target is unknown (unknown class or even if any class structure exists) and the
model seeks to uncover some hidden classification or structure.

>Input data is not labeled and does not have a known result. A model is prepared by deducing structures present in the input data. This may be to extract general rules. It may be through a mathematical process to systematically reduce redundancy, or it may be to organize data by similarity. Example problems are clustering, dimensionality reduction and association rule learning.

## Clustering: like classification but the classes are not known yet, just looking for patterns
>To group samples such that objects within the same cluster are more similar to each other than to the objects from another cluster.

## Association Rules: finding sets of items that occur together in records of a data set and the relationships among those items in order to derive multiple correlations that meet the specified thresholds.
>To discover the probability of the co-occurrence of items in a collection. It is extensively used in market-basket analysis. Example: If a customer purchases bread, he is 80% likely to also purchase eggs.

#### Clustering

#### K-means

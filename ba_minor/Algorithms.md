# Supervised Learning
> the target is known (which class an instance belongs to) and a model is trained to
predict that target.

> Input data is called training data and has a known label or result such as spam/not-spam or a stock price at a time.
A model is prepared through a training process in which it is required to make predictions and is corrected when those predictions are wrong. The training process continues until the model achieves a desired level of accuracy on the training data. Example problems are classification and regression.

## Logistic Regression

# Unsupervised Learning
> the target is unknown (unknown class or even if any class structure exists) and the
model seeks to uncover some hidden classification or structure.

>Input data is not labeled and does not have a known result. A model is prepared by deducing structures present in the input data. This may be to extract general rules. It may be through a mathematical process to systematically reduce redundancy, or it may be to organize data by similarity. Example problems are clustering, dimensionality reduction and association rule learning.

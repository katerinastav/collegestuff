## Data Sampler

## Box Plot

 * Identify Outliers

## Test and Score
* Test on train data uses the whole dataset for training and then for testing. This method practically always gives wrong results.
*Test on test data: the above methods use the data from Data signal only. 

### Classification Columns:

#### CLassification Accuracy (CA)
* CA = #correct predictions/ #total predictions
